# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was created in order to make the taking of and retreival of notes from the Prework for the UCF Coding Bootcamp easy and efficient.  This webpage designs notes by cateogory according to what language notes are being taken in or what program notes are being taken for.  It allows notes to be easily accesible and organized in a manner that makes them efficient to find and retrieve.  In the creation of this webpage, I learned the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned the basics of Git Bash.  Additional, I learned to create a repository and copy that repository to my local machine and then make pull requests and link branches to the main branch, protecting my previous code from any mistakes I may have made in adding code.  I also learned how to debug errors in my code.

When DevTools console is opned, it can be seen that JavaScript is running.  There it lists the topics discussed in the Prework and chooses a topic that would be best for us to study first, which is HTML.
